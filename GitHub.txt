Free and open source version control system.
Version control is the management of files and codes over internet and ability to track all possible changes to the files.
Directory->Folder
command Line/Terminal->Interface to write in text commands
CLI->command line interface
cd->change directory
code editor->text editor
repository->Git repository which usually is the project or the folder where the project is kept
.md->markdown file
Git is the tool used to track changes 
Github is a website where you host all of your git repositories
Git commands:-
1.clone->Bring repository from github to computer (git clone HTTP)
2.add->track your files and changes in git(git add <filename>/ .(for adding all)
3.commit->save files in git (git commit -m "Title" -m "Description")
4.push->upload git commits to a remote repo like GitHub
5.pull->download changes from remote repo to your local machine
6.status->to check the files status as they are uploaded or not
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "gopalvarun03@gmail.com" to generate SSH Key then type a file name and a passcode
ls | grep testkey to search for the SSH key
cat testkey.pub to get the key
pbcopy <~/testkey.pub to copy the text in the testkey file
go to settings on github and add SSH key
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" 
ssh-add ~/.ssh/<filename>
The above 2 lines can be used to link and type them in gitbash.
git push origin(location for git repo) master(branch name)/main
git branch -l to get the branch names
git init to create a new git repo from a local folder
git remote add origin <HTTP of the new repo>
git remote -v to show all the connections made already
now You can use git push origin master / git push -u origin master to set this push path as default
Git branching is used to create new versions(updates) of the main branch and finally if we wish we can merge
git checkout(to switch branch) -b(to create new branch) <branch-name>
git diff <branchname> to find out the difference bw two branches
git merge <branchname> to merge them
Then to merge them go to pull request on git hub and merge them
Now to update the code on local machine use 
git pull origin master
git branch -d version-11 to delete the branch
git commit -am "a" to add and commit a modified file
git reset HEAD~1 to reset last commit
git log to view commits
git reset [file] ->unstages the file, but it preserves the file contents.
git reset [commit] ->undoes all the commits after the specified commit and preserves the changes locally.
git reset â€“hard [commit] ->discards all history and goes back to the specified commit.
